# CRIU GUI Demo

A web-based demonstration of process migration with CRIU.

This demo requires criu, python 2.7, python-webpy, python-psutil, and python-criu to run.

To run the demo:

1. Edit the "targetData" object in static/criugui.js to point to at least two machines (ideally this shouldn't be hardcoded)
2. Make sure the CRIU RPC service is started with `sudo systemctl start criu.socket`.
3. Run `./criugui.py` on **both** machines.
4. Go to http://localhost:8080/ (assuming localhost is one of the machines)

You can click and drag inside each of the panels to pan over the process trees, hover over a process name to see more information about it, and drag and drop a process from one panel to another to attempt to migrate it.  The results of the migration will show up in an alert box on the page.
